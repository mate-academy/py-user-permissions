# Token Authentication API

Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before starting.
- Download [ModHeader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj?hl=en)
- Use the following command to load prepared data from fixture to test and debug your code:
  `python manage.py loaddata cinema_service_db_data.json`.
- After loading data from fixture you can use following superuser (or create another one by yourself):
  - Login: `admin.user`
  - Password: `1qazcde3`

### In this task you will add the functionality of token authentication

At this part of the task, we will do authorization by using tokens. 
The functionality of regular users will be limited so that they cannot add, 
delete or update other data on the site, besides their orders.  
Moreover, only authenticated users will be able to create an order.  
Deletion will be prohibited even for the administrator, 
if only through the admin panel. 
That's because of  when we're deleting, for example, 
a genre, the other relationships from other tables won't be deleted

1. Create serializers and views to support the following endpoints:
   * `POST api/user/register/` - You can create here a user (password length must be >= 5 symbols)
   * `POST api/user/login/` - You can get a token, if you write the correct data
   * `GET/PUT/PATCH api/user/me/` - Information about user and possibility to update information about user


Example:
```python
HTTP 200 OK
Allow: GET, PUT, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept

{
    "id": 1,
    "username": "admin1",
    "email": "",
    "is_staff": true
}
```

2. By default, all API endpoints (inside cinema app) must have the following action limitations depending on the user role:

 * Implement such custom permission class `IsAdminOrIfAuthenticatedReadOnly`.

3. Make **only** such actions available for views:
   * `GenreViewSet` - list and create
   * `CinemaHallViewSet` - list and create
   * `ActorViewSet` - list and create 
   * `MovieViewSet` - list, create and retrieve
   * `MovieSessionViewSet` - list, retrieve, create, update, partial_update, delete
   * `OrderViewSet` - list and create


4. `OrderViewSet` - We should give the ability for authenticated users to create order

`Note` all tests should pass. `user/tests` & `cinema/tests`

### Note: Check your code using this [checklist](checklist.md) before pushing your solution.
